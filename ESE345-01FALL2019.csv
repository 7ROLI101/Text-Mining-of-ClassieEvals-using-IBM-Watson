"Valuable","This course really is amazing from cover to cover. The first half of the course focuses on the basic rules and laws of computer architecture such as algorithms computers, how computers encode numbers, computer performance, and different basics of computers. The second half of the course is really the fun part though. You go through different types of processors and how they work, advantages and disadvantages of these processors among other things. All this culminates in a second test on computer design and a project using VHDL. Its really cool to see how this class brings the other classes together such as ESE218/118, ESE380/280, and ESE382 and its really beautiful to see how a computer works, especially coming from someone who wants to focus on being a hardware engineer over software. My advice is to really pay attention in lecture. Missing a lecture is really a shame in this class because Professor Dorojevets is not only extremely knowledgeable on the topic but, he may also be the most passionate professor I have ever had. Also his stories about his school career and industry career are really great and he has a good sense of humor and is a really nice guy even if he may seem a bit intimidating at first.

Make sure to read the textbook also it has vital information in it that will help you. Also if a concept doesn't make sense make sure you go to your TA or Professor Dorojevets and clear it up you do not want to fall behind because there will be a lot of new information in the next lecture. Overall though this course is amazing and its a pleasure to take with someone as knowledgeable as Professor Dorojevets."
"Valuable","Learning computer architecture (registers, memory, cache, ALU, etc) was great for a computer engineer. The project was very useful in helping me understand the material, as we were actually implementing the structures in VHDL, despite it being very long and complicated to do.

TA Ryan was great."
"Needs Improvement","The descriptions for certain instructions should be more clear. Also, the second midterm took more time to complete than what was given. Professor should post example problems to help students out."
"Needs Improvement","This class is perfect as is."
