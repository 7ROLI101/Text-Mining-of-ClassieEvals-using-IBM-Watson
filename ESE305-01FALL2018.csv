"Valuable","Prof Milder did really well at explaining the material. I like that he wrote out notes and the notes had plenty of explanation and explained general concepts really well. Homework and exams were fair. The material was very interesting and a good foundation to signal processing and analysis that I would like to continue studying as a major in Biomedical Engineering. I loved the use of late days and they were extremely helpful to me to get through and do well this semester. The class was a friendly environment and a pleasure to be in. Awesome class!"
"Valuable","The lectures were extremely good. The lectures were very well taught.The notes used were very detailed and in depth. The professor tried very hard to make sure students had any questions clarified. He made lectures interactive too as well. He was very engaged with the students. He explained things very thoroughly. This professor can teach very well, and it is evident in his amazing lectures which are the most valuable aspects of this course. The lectures were also very organized, and well done."
"Valuable","Prof. Milder is very organized. He is very clear when he goes over the course in lecture and has numerous examples and notes on any given topic. It helps a lot when comes time to study for test and when doing homework."
"Valuable","Professor was very accommodating, helpful, and knowledgeable about the subject. One of the best EE professors out there right now, homeworks were fair and lecture notes were very organized and easy to follow"
"Valuable","He started with a blank slide and went along writing as we did, addressing things as we went along. Good structure and organization. Very forgiving and logical i all aspects"
"Valuable","Learning about various signal processing techniques. Learning about Fourier series and transform and Laplace transforms were really helpful."
"Valuable","The instructor is very approachable and provides a lot of examples for students to help understand the material."
"Valuable","The material he goes over in class is handwritten and posted on blackboard. It is easy to understand."
"Valuable","Milder makes learning anything so much easier cause of how he handles questions and concepts"
"Valuable","Great professor!! He could teach the material really clearly!"
"Valuable","Varied homework examples and clear guidelines."
"Valuable","The teacher explains very well the contents."
"Valuable","The content taught"
"Needs Improvement","The homework assignments could be a bit tedious in their length and the amount of calculations. In addition, it was usually not explicit in how to do the problems from the lecture notes alone; it could take a long time to figure out the process or how to start. I think less frequent and shorter assignments would improve the course. In addition, people who had solutions to homework assignments to previous years could have an unfair advantage as usually just the numbers were changed. Finally, although the exam questions were fair, it did put us in a bit of a time crunch and could be hard to finish, you had to be very familiar with how to do the problems."
"Needs Improvement","At times the material is really abstract and mathematical. For example, we cover signals that are non-causal, but realistically engineering will only deal with causal systems. Perhaps reinforcing the material with real-life applications would help put the topics in context with what we are learning in other classes. Also more MATLAB exercises or projects would be nice."
"Needs Improvement","Perhaps give some practice exams, if able. Aside from that I have no other problems with the course. I wish all professors were this organized and clear."
"Needs Improvement","posting practice exams, but other than that, one of the best professors I've had."
"Needs Improvement","Nothing, it's exactly what a 300-level EE course should consist of"
"Needs Improvement","None comes to mind at the moment. Mostly personal improvement."
"Needs Improvement","Can't think of anything that needed improvement except myself"
"Needs Improvement","This course had very little imperfections."
"Needs Improvement","No, it is already great."
"Needs Improvement","None"
