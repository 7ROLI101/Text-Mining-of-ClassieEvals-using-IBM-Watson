"Valuable","Absolutely love anything Professor Short teaches. Learning VHDL is a little weird at first because the language itself is strange, but Short teaches it extremely well. If you didn't like 218 and think digital logic is hard, Professor Short will make it seem easy. The labs were fantastic. Scott is retiring this semester, so unfortunately future students won't get the experience, but we will miss him and he brought a lot to lab."
"Valuable","Professor Short is one of if not the best professors in the department.  He explains the topics as clearly as anyone could expect and he definitely cares about his students and is dedicated to teaching.  He is very helpful in his office hours.  ESE 382, like 380 (now 280) is difficult and requires a lot of work, but you will learn a lot and maybe even enjoy it depending on your interest."
"Valuable","Professor Short is the BEST professor in this department I wish he taught all of my EE classes. His notes are extremely well written and easy to understand and he is always willing to help if you have any questions with labs or even if you don't understand something. The labs also really help bring the material learned in class to life. Great class."
"Valuable","Learning how VHDL works is extremely valuable for future computer engineers, and the re-enforcement of digital design concepts introduced in ESE 218 (now 118) greatly aided comprehension in design of finite state machines and other applications of digital logic."
"Valuable","This course was very well organized and thought out by Professor Short. He is very thorough in teaching the material. VHDL is very important if you want to go into the FPGA space and I found it very helpful to learn about it in such an exceptional class."
"Valuable","Professor Short is extremely knowledgeable in digital design, his lecture and lab explanations are very thorough and useful for studying/performing labs.  He wrote the textbook for the course and it is such a useful tool for the same reasons."
"Valuable","I though the lectures were very useful in understanding the topics needed for laboratory."
"Valuable","The material is very useful and Professor Short is a great professor."
"Valuable","The skills learned in VHDL. Real life lab application"
"Valuable","Learning VHDL"
"Needs Improvement","Almost all exam questions are application/design-based, but there are occasionally a few theoretical questions that seem divorced from the rest of the class's contents. The exact workings of a CMOS transistor or how exactly timing models in an event-driven simulation work is not really essential to understanding VHDL or digital design, and being tested on these concepts for a quarter of the weight of the total exam seems excessive when the same weight is given to questions that have the student design an entire system with multiple architectures."
"Needs Improvement","More time in lecture should be spent on some of the more technical aspects of VHDL, particularly typecasting vs type conversion and when to use each one, to_integer, to_unsigned, to_string, when you need std_logic_vector'( as opposed to std_logic_vector(,  and other similar things.

The paid graduate TAs need to be instructed to always give a reason for deducting points off people's exams.  Apparently they are told this multiple times but they don't seem to listen.  Something should be done to better enforce this."
"Needs Improvement","Test us on more topics. I absolutely loved and studied hard for the class, but Professor Short didn't test us on some important topics."
"Needs Improvement","Sometimes the lectures felt slow because the material was a bit dull, but overall the course is very good."
"Needs Improvement","Wish the lectures weren't so boring, but sometimes it can't be helped given the nature of the course"
"Needs Improvement","N/A, this course was amazing"
"Needs Improvement","Nothing, class is great."
"Needs Improvement","More lab TAs"
"Needs Improvement","Nothing"
