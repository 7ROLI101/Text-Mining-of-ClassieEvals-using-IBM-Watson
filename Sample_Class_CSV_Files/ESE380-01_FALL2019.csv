"Valuable","While I didn't like Kenneth Short as a professor at first, he really grew on me. He really is preparing us for industry. His expectations of us can be a bit much at times, but I feel a lot better about handling a job in industry now that I've gone through this course. Writing assembly code has been an absolute pleasure and it is fucking beautiful to see how 1s and 0s are all that's at play in these complex systems. This class is definitely in my top 3 favorite classes at stony brook."
"Valuable","This course is essential for computer engineers and gives a deep insight to the inner workings of memory and how to use registers to develop both simple and complex systems. This course gave me a deeper understanding of finite state machines, system stacks, and pointers to use in developing programs.Overall, ESE 280 is great for those who are interested in the hardware meets software aspect of computer engineering."
"Valuable","Everything in this class was valuable and all of it is owed to Professor Short and his natural ability to clearly and thoroughly explain any given topic. I really enjoyed listening to the man in lecture and debugging my programs outside of lab. It brought me a sense of joy when my code executed perfectly."
"Valuable","The professor knows exactly what he is doing. The labs were very helpful in learning the topic. If you perform the labs properly, you will understand the topics very well. Exams were very reasonable."
"Valuable","The labs because the hands-on experience allows students to apply the knowledge learned in lecture. The labs are also more practical, so you end up learning more from them."
"Valuable","prof short is a pretty ok professor. hes a really nice guy, office hours are helpful. the tests (except the first one) were all fair."
"Valuable","The labs were very helpful in my opinion because it helped me understand the concepts better."

"Needs Improvement","The exams are by far the most stressful thing about this class because the pacing of his teaching isn't the same every year so previous exams could have material that was never covered and lead to difficulty in trying to prepare for our exams. The grading of the exams can vary between TA's since some are more lenient than others but the nice thing is that they're not looking for perfect code and are mainly looking for lines of code that are essential.

Note: In my opinion the exams tested how fast you could formulate a program to solve the problem which was sometimes difficult because he would drop some complicated looking circuit with a wall of text describing the system and not allow you to ask any questions during the exam (so you can't ask to clarify what the system actually does). You have to create a program based on an assumption you make and hope your assumption is correct."
"Needs Improvement","Professor Short could be more organized in lecture. He does a lot of scribbling on the side, and sometimes it is really valuable information, but he will quickly erase it or go to another slide. I would like to see him posting the marked up versions of the slides from the lectures so we can go back and see his side notes. It would also nice to have echoes for this course. Professor Short was asked about this at the beginning of the semester and he said the room wasn't set up for echo, but I took AMS301 in the same exact room as this class and we have echoes, so I know the room is set up. Also, there absolutely must be a curve that accounts for the Friday lab sections having a clear advantage over the earlier sections. For this reason I believe the grading was unfair."
"Needs Improvement","this course is WAY too much work with 3 other major classes. the labs basically required you to know everything before we even learned it. if you have a bad lab partner your life is gonna be pretty miserable this semester. the first test was really uncalled for and the whole class failed it. everyone hypes up this class on here but its really not that incredible, its a lot of work and its kinda really boring. i hope he curves this semester way better than previous since the average was always so high."
"Needs Improvement","This course required a lot of personal time to learn the material since there was no homework/practice problems aside from right before an exam. Also, the exams can be a bit challenging and confusing at times, where it is hard to decipher what exactly the questions are asking for."
"Needs Improvement","While the tests are difficult and rules are strict, I think these are necessary evils for instilling a good work ethic. I honestly think this is the best course SBU has to offer."
"Needs Improvement","The professor talks in a very relaxed manner. He talks fairly slowly so that everyone can keep pace, but this makes it hard not to fall asleep sometimes."
"Needs Improvement","The lab is good, the exam questions have too many words and some question is confusing. I hope the professor can give questions briefly."
"Needs Improvement","change instructor"
