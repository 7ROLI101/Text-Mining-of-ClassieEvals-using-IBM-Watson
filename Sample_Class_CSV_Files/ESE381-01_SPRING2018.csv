"TYPE","COMMENT"
"Valuable","Very detailed design concepts like timing limitations, voltage compatibility, ADC architectures. and many other analog components incorporated in this course. This is the best class to see how analog system interact with digital system design and to understand the limitations of both. Very nicely designed course each year."
"Valuable","Prof. Short's 38X courses are always the best! 
never regret to take them. They are so interesting and worth to take.
Do learn and practice a lot during the lecture and lab section!"
"Valuable","Lab work. The two-week modules gave us plenty of time to properly build, program and debug our circuits."
"Needs Improvement","Increase in the pace of the class. Easier labs but with more tasks and more materials covered. Maybe announce the requirements of design manual 2 or 3 weeks earlier to allow more time to do the assignment."
"Needs Improvement","best course."
"Needs Improvement","Nothing."
