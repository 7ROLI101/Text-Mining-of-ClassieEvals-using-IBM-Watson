"Valuable","Professor Short is very good at explaining the material to the class. Sometimes he might explain a simple concept for far too long and the class falls asleep because of that, but some other people will need it. He is the hardest working professor in the ECE department in my opinion."
"Valuable","Professor Short is a great professor. His lecture slides summarize the book very well. The labs are also interesting. I have a lot of respect for Professor Short as he makes his classes challenging, which prepares students for real world problems. I learned a lot in this class."
"Valuable","Having textbook that was written by the teacher is almost invaluable. It synchronizes the lectures almost 1:1 with the material in the textbook, making it extremely easy to review and find information from the textbook."
"Valuable","Learning the syntax and structure of VHDL. Although it wasn't easy for me, and I didn't put a lot of time into learning the language properly, it wasn't extremely difficult either."
"Valuable","The ESE 38x courses are always a challenging delight. They may be stressful at times, but you get what you put into them, that's for sure. Definitely teaches you to prioritize."
"Valuable","Prof. Short is very knowledgeable about the topic, and explains things in a very clear way. Labs and exams are a little tough but fair."
"Valuable","Reading the slides from lecture is a must in order to understand what goes on and how to code."
"Valuable","Quickly learn a language that isn't so well known but used widely throughout the industry"
"Valuable","Learning VHDL and learning to program PLDs is overall important to learn."
"Valuable","Learning about plus and fpga programming"
"Valuable","Learning how to program in VHDL"
"Valuable","Learning VHDL Programming."
"Valuable","labs are fun"

"Needs Improvement","Professor Short's exams are unreasonably difficult at times. You can make a test challenging where the average will fall around 60s or you can make it so that most of the students will fail and average would be a lot lower. The latter discourages a lot of students who aren't excelling but want to get better. The second midterm was extremely hard and there wasn't enough time to finish it. Also, there should be some homework assignments along with labs so that students get more practice with VHDL syntax since the syntax is a lot different than the programming languages most people are used to."
"Needs Improvement","Make it slightly faster, Short goes slow which is great.. you can follow along and understand well, BUT he is monotone and slow and his soothing voice kind of puts you to sleep."
"Needs Improvement","The pace of the lectures was too slow, and his teaching style is boring and puts many students to sleep."
"Needs Improvement","Giant acceleration in topic difficulty and topics learned each lecture in thew middle of the semester."
"Needs Improvement","The wording of the descriptions on the tests as well as some of the labs could be better."
"Needs Improvement","Not much, lab is great, midterms and finals are fair. A+ professor."
"Needs Improvement","Short is doing a great job in lecture, I'm totally content."
"Needs Improvement","Exams are way too difficult compared to sample exams."
"Needs Improvement","TESTS ARE TOO TIME CONSUMING!!!!!!!!! That is all."
"Needs Improvement","midterms are harder than previous years"
"Needs Improvement","Nothing short is the man!"
"Needs Improvement","good"
"Needs Improvement","N/A"
