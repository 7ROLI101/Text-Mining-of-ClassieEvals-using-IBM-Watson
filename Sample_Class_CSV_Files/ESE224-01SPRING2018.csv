"Valuable","Learned much more about C++ and programming techniques, examples in slides were gone over and professor answered questions with knowledge and easy to understand explanations."
"Valuable","The amount of resources that the proffessor provides to the students as well as very informative lectures."
"Valuable","I personally just enjoyed the curriculum of the course since I like programming."
"Valuable","It is coding so the course is helpful when going to the outside world."
"Valuable","Learning about STL containers."
"Valuable","I learned about classes"
"Needs Improvement","Professor was not very well at lecturing the powerpoints were very vague and general aimed towards more advanced students who had better grasps of the material. Assignments and exercises asked much more of what is covered in class, so much time was spent reading and searching for concepts online. Improvement would be to have more interaction with students or simpler in class exercises with more frequency, so the student can learn little by little to build up and use tools for the assignment and earn points, post more examples of codes and methods needed not just 1 simple one on the powerpoint. Have these exercises worth a little more. I would recommend looking at the source codes in assignments and giving partial credit for programs that did not compile but if the student understood the concepts, instead of if it does not run no points are given. Extra credit concept questions or online quizzes to help boost points as not everyone in this class was a computer engineering/science major having only seen one programming class prior if they're electrical engineering."
"Needs Improvement","While I did mostly like this course, I had to teach myself pretty much everything. I attended every lecture since it was required but I don't feel as though the professor ever effectively taught the material. She often just read from the textbook. Working through specific programs and talking about each line of code would be a much more effective way of teaching. The thing that frustrated me the most about the course was the attendance policy. It was a 8:30 AM and the professor was frequently, if not always, 5-10 minutes late. I thought it was really unreasonable to make attendance such a large part of the grade given this and also the general nature of the course as a programming class. If the professor wants high lecture attendance, they should give engaging and helpful lectures, not just force everyone to come."
"Needs Improvement","The teacher could not expect 2nd semester coding ESE students to know how to code like a CSE senior.  Absolutely absurd how much time i've spent studying and working on assignments to still not even get it.  Even the TAs did not know exactly how to do it.  From Ese124 where the professor was a slow teacher and showing us how to print “hello world” to the screen and simple loops. To Ese224, make a bank simulation of customers and tellers n transactions. It’s like running 1 mile and then being like ok good job now go run a marathon. There is no middle ground, and I understand it’s suppose to be hard so you struggle and learn but you shouldn’t have to spend 50 hours on one assignment, we do have other work for other classes too."
"Needs Improvement","I wish the way the information for the course was taught in a different and more understanding way. It felt like i was expected to know more than I actually knew coming into the course. I know that the course has a pre-requisite but, the course felt like you needed more than that."
"Needs Improvement","I feel that if the class was offered in a later time students would be more focused to come to class because a 8:30am class on coding is kinda intense thing to do to a student in the morning. Its hard to focus"
"Needs Improvement","She didn't really teach the subject matter. Most of the learning in this course comes from self teaching. Assignment expectations were incredibly high."
"Needs Improvement","Professor is not the best at teaching and explaining. she is however very nice and willing to help"
"Needs Improvement","Have more office hours available."
