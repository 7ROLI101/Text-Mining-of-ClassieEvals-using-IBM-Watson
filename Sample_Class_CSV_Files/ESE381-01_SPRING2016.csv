"Valuable","Introduction to embedded C. 380 teaches students a lot, but using assembler is slow and tedious, despite giving the programmer a more thorough understanding of whats happening. This course is a great way to understand how these higher level languages are actually used to perform real world functions, rather than just printing calculations on a screen (124 cough cough...)"
"Valuable","Important class to take if you are interested in getting into embedded software. You do get some level of exposure to selecting components and interfacing them with a microcontroller."
"Valuable","I like professor Short's class. The materials are always interesting and he makes thing clearly. He is very helpful in class or off class and in lab. I learned a lot from this class."
"Valuable","Provided much more detail on functions of microcontrollers than 380 did, covering many things that we did not cover in the first portion of the 2 semester sequence."
"Valuable","Putting a whole project together over a semester gives us an idea on how to chop up a system's development into smaller parts."
"Valuable","The labs are very important for us to understand more on our lecture."
"Needs Improvement","This is possibly the worst class I have ever taken.  After taking 380, I wanted to give embedded systems another chance because I really enjoy the subject.  However, Professor Short makes this class a living nightmare with mandatory attendance, unclear lectures, vague lecture notes, and impossible requirements for his students.
Professor Short needs to get off his high horse and stop assigning this amount of work.  This is a 4 credit class but he insists on giving us the amount of work as a 6-7 credit class.  Some students, such as myself, are taking 20+ credits.  This does not give us time to go to the ESDL lab when the TAs and Scott decide they feel like scheduling arbitrary lab hours yet the labs for this class are nearly impossible to finish in the allotted 3 hour time slot.  This is unacceptable.  If students consistently have to come in for an additional 5-6 hours a week to complete a lab, that means that the requirements for the lab are over the top and need to be reduced.  Professor Short assigns more work than several of my other engineering classes combined.  He is not effective at teaching the material either.  He gives dry lectures with notes that he annotates by hand in class but insists on not uploading after the class is over.  This only gives students their own copied notes from his usually confusing and rambling thought process.  Looking back over the notes from class, you realize that they are next to useless because Professor Short does not know how to instruct.  It is time for him to retire and for the ESE department to give us a decent teacher who does not make the class impossibly difficult for the pure sake of being difficult."
"Needs Improvement","Ideal source code solutions to labs that have passed to be released to the students. Drivers were given to us for the LCD screen, but UI related functions were not given to us. I understand that we were responsible for that, but it takes more than a few lab sections to make a good UI, especially when we don't even know what are the next features to be implement on the screen in following labs! Also the final project this semester sucked. Other semester projects seem way more promising. Everything with this project had to be implemented with Timer/Counters, which was ridiculous. Hopefully the next project is less timer/counter intensive. This course goes great with 304 and 324 btw."
"Needs Improvement","The class is very slow. Sitting in class is often very tiring and the material is taught very slowly. Also the amount of time that has to be invest in this class climbs sharply at the end of the semester when preparing the report and completing the final labs."
"Needs Improvement","Project was not as interesting or applicable as the one for 380 was, but it allowed for a full understanding of additional topics."
"Needs Improvement","Not really."
