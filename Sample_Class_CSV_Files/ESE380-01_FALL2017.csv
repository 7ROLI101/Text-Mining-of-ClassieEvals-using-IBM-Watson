"Valuable","Nothing at all, I'm an Electrical Engineer. Emphasis on electrical. Circuits, hardware, large energy systems. I've spend more time coding in this class than in any of the required coding classes (ESE 124 and ESE 224). There is no value to this course for Electrical Engineers."
"Valuable","The actual basic of computers and their architecture felt useful. The debounce circuits and multiplexing circuits were very interesting and seem like very practical circuits to know and understand. I liked how partial signatures could be given for mostly-working code."
"Valuable","professor short is very methodical and thorough when lecturing. his voice is also quite relaxing to listen to. he uses a tablet and pen to draw on the slides while explaining, which really helped me understand the order in which things happened."
"Valuable","Attend lectures, professor annotates notes but doesn't post them.  Lectures have lots of materials.  Microprocessor data sheet is the Bible.  Lots of lab work, with high standards.  Keeping on top of coding is a must."
"Valuable","Professor Short's lecturing style was crystal clear and he was an excellent asset.  He made learning about AVR microcontrollers extremely simple, and he is the best professor I have had yet at Stony Brook."
"Valuable","The best thing I liked about this course was that it was focused on both hardware and software. As a Computer Engineer I like to see how the code affects the machine right in front of my eyes."
"Valuable","It took a ton of the stuff I learned in ESE123 and ESE218 and solidified it. I can't wait to take 381 and 382 with Short again because of that."
"Valuable","This course is very hands-on and teaches students how to think about particular issues and situations while designing."
"Valuable","Kenneth Short is by far the best engineering teacher at Stony Brook, very helpful, thorough and professional"
"Valuable","very interesting course, Prof. Short made it very interesting.  learning micro-process itself is valuable."
"Valuable","Well the course was interesting but that is about it. Do not understand why is it a requirement"
"Valuable","Leaned AVR. Learned assembly very well (even though coding isnt my forte)"
"Valuable","The level of competition in the class."
"Valuable","Great Professor and excellent course!"
"Valuable","The lab work"
"Needs Improvement","The class is very hard. You have to put your heart and soul into the class but you do enjoy doing it. I didnt like coding in assembly (cause im not good at coding) but somehow I still went to everyone of his lectures and enjoyed it. He was very reasonable with labs and his tests were fair (even though it was very difficult) but i enjoyed him and his lectures and never felt like skipping his class EVER. Short is one of the best professors ive had at Stony Brook and im excited to take im next semester for 382 (even though that class will kick my butt).Ps. He always jokes about me and our friends 'being too happy' cause we laugh alot before lecture and he is very lax for a guy whos probably 50 years older than us"
"Needs Improvement","It can be improved by not being required for Electrical engineers, it is not valuable to my course or life track. I do not plan on looking at any microprocessing or coding in assembly at any point in my life after this course. The code is too complex for someone to simply learn throughout the course of the semester and the hardware although useful has not been tested since the first midterm (there are 3). All around this course is a useless pile of nonsense that I do not feel I needed to take nor will be sufficient in my career after I graduate. This class will only be something that lowers my GPA due to its lack of important content to my career agenda/my title of an ESE major."
"Needs Improvement","The course can be improved by teaching modern embedded system with an operating system. This course does not feel like a 300 level course. First of all computer engineers need a different embedded systems course this is more geared towards electrical engineers. There was not point of teaching assembly in this course. To learn assembly computer engineers should be required to take CSE 320. This course should be after ESE 333. The project should consist of an arm processor with RTOS opertating system. Otherwise just replace this with ESE 355"
"Needs Improvement","The class has a first set of labs that are identical year to year and then it goes into an application specific project that Short chooses every year. The first labs felt very useless, especially labs 5-8 since they used the same exact functionality just in different ways. The class barely touched on SPI, and never discussed UART, I2C or other peripheral functions of the microcontroller. OFten times code was just given to us and we didn't need to fully understand the material. The course should cover more content."
"Needs Improvement","This semester for 380 was sort of all over the place, the lecture for indirect call was given after the midterm it was on, and there was no prior coding experience. I would have just liked a more straightforward 'these instructions do x, y and z' and then to be given a critical thinking question solvable with those tools. A lot of the time I was just searching around for the proper instruction in order to figure out the lab"
"Needs Improvement","sometimes his voice gets too relaxing and i zone out only to come back 3 minutes later completely lost, or i'll look away to check an email and look back to see a whole new topic... so what i'm saying is that i wish his lectures were recorded on echo."
"Needs Improvement","Less stuff out of left field on the exams or stuff that's hard to interpret, especially when I understand how to code it but just can't tell what it's asking for. Otherwise amazing class."
"Needs Improvement","In class he teaches about the micro controller and assembly code, however the test are entirely about assembly language and not the rest of the learned material."
"Needs Improvement","Professor short should have covered Table Lookup earlier in the course. This way it would have been easier to understand during the labs."
"Needs Improvement","this is a great course, i loved it regardless of what i get, lab work is amazing.  i think exams pattern should be changed."
"Needs Improvement","Doing more program simulations in the class."
"Needs Improvement","Prelabs should be due later at night"
"Needs Improvement","It can't be."
