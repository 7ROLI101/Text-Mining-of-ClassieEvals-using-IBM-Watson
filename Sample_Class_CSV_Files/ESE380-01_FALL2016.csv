"Valuable","This course is the best course i have taken so far. lecture and lab are combined so good. materials about ATmega16 are taught pretty well and completely. Lecture time is controlled very well, professor even makes alarm to control the lecture time. The course is in a very good organization. Reading assignment is assigned logically with the lab at that week. Materials posted on the BB are very sufficient. Course design is very good. it combines the software and hardware knowledge of embedded system and focus on software designing. Unlike some other courses, after taking this course, i feel i really learned important knowledge and skills. I am pretty sure and confident that i can use ATmega16 well after taking the course."
"Valuable","Professor Short is great at teaching the material. He's always there to help you out if you don't understand something during lecture. The textbook is also great and really helps supplement the details that don't get covered in lecture. Short's tests are challenging but you feel good about them because you know that you're learning. There are also no homeworks or quizzes so you really have to be on top of your readings as well as the labs or else you'll be lost in the class. Its a great class if you just work really hard (AND DONT TAKE IT WITH 319 IN THE SAME SEMESTER)."
"Valuable","Professor Short's added reading materials are essential to really understand EVERY aspect of the material. There's a lot of information to sift through, but none of it is irrelevant. The textbook is fabulous: it's a quick read and makes for a great reference guide in lab. Professor Short was great at answering any questions I brought him and would break down material to its minutia if that's what it took to understand a topic. This is not a course to be afraid of, it tests your limits and gives you an appreciation for preparation and time management."
"Valuable","This course is ridiculously good. It basically teaches you everything you need to know about programming on a microprocessor - specifically the ATMega16A. You learn about all the little details in a nicely-paced fashion. You really learn to think in assembly and be able to solve problems that aren't necessarily so straight-forward. Professor Short is really good at teaching, as well. It helps that ESE123 is basically an intro to this course."
"Valuable","This is definitely one of the most useful classes in the electrical engineering program. This is a class where you can actually do something and apply your knowledge rather than simply just learning theory. It is a tough course (a lot of work and very fast paced) but definitely a good course. Learning to design and program embedded systems is pretty much essential for most electrical engineering applications."
"Valuable","The fact that you had to design. In many of the courses in the department, a lot of theory is covered, but hardly any design is introduced. In this class, every week a new code was written and you had to apply knowledge rather than just reference it from somewhere else."
"Valuable","Fantastic Class!! I really enjoyed learning the immense amount of information packed into the one class. I think that the professor did a great job in teaching the students and I can't wait to take another class of his next semester."
"Valuable","This class is awesome and is one of the first courses where application really becomes important. Professor Short is one of the best professors in the major, and he is extremely effective at teaching the material."
"Valuable","This class is all about the labs. It is very good practice for breadboard prototyping and learning assembly, and paves the way to obtain a deeper understanding of both microcontrollers and embedded systems."
"Valuable","I don't know anything about embedded software before I take this calss. But now, I can write at least 100 lines assembly code. It was quite challenge but I am glad to learn about microcontroller."
"Valuable","Excellent course that introduces CE/EE students to embeded system. Professor Short is very helpful and knowledgable in the subject matter."
"Valuable","The course content is extremely in depth and the applications and usefulness of the material is obvious immediately."
"Valuable","Professor Short is a great teacher and the subject matter of the course is taught very fairly and used practically"
"Valuable","very interesting. taught proper wiring and coding. also taught how to write theory papers"
"Valuable","Just about everything, from the topics covered, to the exposure to assembly language."
"Valuable","This class taught me so much more than I knew previously about embedded design."
"Valuable","The ppt files and lab sessions were the most valuable parts in this course."
"Valuable","This course was just absolutely fantastic. Everything was valuable."
"Valuable","Some assembly programming and basic embedded systems design."
"Valuable","Very enriching content, good hands on experience."
"Valuable","Short is clear and concise,"
"Valuable","all good"
"Needs Improvement","Exams. Too much work in too little time. As a student who excelled in lab, I felt the exams did not reflect my knowledge of the subject accurately. Also, I felt this class was not 'Embedded Systems Design I' but rather 'Things you can do with an ATMega16A microcontroller'. This class is only useful to us if we plan on working in an environment which uses AVR microcontrollers. I wish we received a more broad education on embedded systems, instead of focusing on just one application. While it was good to gain in-lab experience, I thought I would take away knowledge of embedded systems and left knowing only the specifics of one microcontroller used in embedded systems. I feel this class should be offered as a lower level class, right after ESE123 because this truly is just another introductory course with a huge workload."
"Needs Improvement","I think the graduate teaching assistants need to become more acquainted with coding. It seemed like the undergraduate TAs were more effective in the classroom, but there were times when the order of a few lines of code would be swapped, and the graduate TA would take off points, even though the order of the code in that particular scenario did not matter."
"Needs Improvement","There is a lot of extra reading material in this course. All of it is warranted and useful, but there is just so much of it. I could not keep up with all of it and would often be reading up on material while writing my pre-lab assignments. I'm definitely better off for having read said material, but I felt as though I was regularly two steps behind."
"Needs Improvement","I don't know why the professor doesn't put lecture notes on Blackboard (he puts the slides, but not the annotated versions) - maybe as a way of ensuring people go to class? I'm not quite sure. Aside from that, the course is fine as is."
"Needs Improvement","As I said in the lab review of this course, it is an intense workload. While a large workload is needed to learn the material, some weeks it is very hard to manage it in addition to all of the other work required from other classes."
"Needs Improvement","The class should probably have echos because there were times when Professor Short would say something that I wouldn't quite catch the first time."
"Needs Improvement","I think there should be recitation for the students, so that they can practice and ask about instructions and directives in ATmega16a assembler."
"Needs Improvement","Not at all. It's great. I hope Prof. Short sticks around for as long as possible, he is an incredible asset to the department."
"Needs Improvement","No more coding in x86 assembly PLEASE! Both 380 and 381 should code in C instead of assembly."
"Needs Improvement","If there are more review sessions outside the class, this course would be better."
"Needs Improvement","ESE 380 is perfect. nothing to improve."
"Needs Improvement","Allow embedded systems in class"
"Needs Improvement","None, keep it exactly the same"
"Needs Improvement","Course is great as is."
"Needs Improvement","SO MUCH WORK man chill"
"Needs Improvement","nothing"
