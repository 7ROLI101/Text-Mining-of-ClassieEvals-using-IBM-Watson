"Valuable","372 is the single class that makes you no longer afraid of circuits. Electrical engineering no longer feels like wizardry once you get to this course. A lot of misconceptions you've had in 271 are clarified in 372, and you begin to feel confident about analyzing and recognizing the application of circuit elements. The material in this class is difficult on the surface, but Leon is very fair. The tests are reasonable and the homeworks are infrequent. Compared to 211 (a 2 credit course), it's probably 30% the work per week despite 372 being 4 credits. Despite the workload being low, you still come out of the course feeling like you digested the material well, thus proving that high workload =/= learning which many SBU professors don't realize. Leon also grills students who ask dumb questions or hand in HW late, which is very entertaining."
"Valuable","This class was not that valuable for me as a Computer Engineering major and a software-focused person. Most CEs don't need to know the fundamentals of how semiconductors work and I think this class should be an elective for CE majors, rather than a requirement. There should be more coursework in areas that a CE might make a career in, such as embedded systems, low-level programming, FPGAs, etc. This is very much an upper-division electrical engineering course that you just need to take because it is a requirement."
"Valuable","The Professor is a nice guy who cares about you understanding the material of the course overall. After a poor performance on the first midterm, he allows for retakes. After some additional poor performances on the second midterm, he allows for 'extra credit' in the form of doing well on the final. More about learning the material when its all said and done, no matter how long it may take to click."
"Valuable","FINALLY being taught how transistors work after hearing about them so much since ESE 123 is great. Understanding properly how bode plots and frequency responses in general are to be created and interpreted is also helpful. The professor is very helpful and willing to pace the lectures with the students' needs if things get boring or unclear."
"Valuable","I thought that the professor's lectures were really well done. He usually made sure that students understood what was going on in class."
"Valuable","The professor cares about the students and makes sure everybody understands the material by teaching in an interesting manner."
"Valuable","The professor genuinely cares about students and will consistently ask if he is clear or needs to go over anything again"
"Valuable","This class provides a good base for understanding how to analyze analog circuits using amplifiers and transistors."
"Valuable","Leon is the best professor in this department"
"Valuable","Introducing MOSFETS and BJT's I guess"
"Needs Improvement","This class is waaaaaaay too theoretical. I still don't even know how to use a BJT or MOSFET in a circuit, but I sure can analyze them. Additionally, I had to do most of my learning before midterms through the practice exams posted before hand since there were barely any problems done in class. I think that the emphasis on theoretical derivations of every equation isn't really useful. I just want to know how to analyze the circuit, if I am interested in the theory behind it I can look it up or supplementary material can be provided. More problems in class!"
"Needs Improvement","The first third of the class feels disconnected from the latter two, focusing on diodes, filters, and rectifiers as one big topic while bipolar junction transistors and MOSFETS each get their own sections. Such a massive weight on exams (70% for midterms and finals vs 30% for homeworks) also seems excessive and puts too much pressure on students to not screw up on a specific day."
"Needs Improvement","The first third of the course is a little bumpy. 372 assumes we know Bode plots and RLC circuits like the back of our hand from 271, but this isn't true. Many of us had to learn these concepts in 372 so the first third of the class tends to feel overwhelming. The second and final thirds of the class are a lot more fair."
"Needs Improvement","The recitation in my eyes is useless but by providing additional practice problems straight to blackboard, similar to midterm/final practice tests, would allow for easier access to practice the material for the exams."
"Needs Improvement","Using the premade slides makes it difficult to determine the steps followed in the examples. It would be much easier to follow if the examples and content were all taught and done by hand on the projector."
"Needs Improvement","If this is meant to be a requirement for a CE major, there should be a focus on why this matters to a CE major."
"Needs Improvement","Variable notation is terrible in this class please make your variables more distinguishable"
"Needs Improvement","Could allow the students to attempt to design an amplifier using MOSFETs/BJTs/Op-Amps"
"Needs Improvement","ECHO the class so that things he goes in-depth to in class can be reviewed"
"Needs Improvement","javits 103 is too squeaky"
