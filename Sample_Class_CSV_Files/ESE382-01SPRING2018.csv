"Valuable","This course very practical and we ended up making a real time clock.  Pretty much what you expect from a Short class; well organized, well taught.  Labs in the beginning were pretty straight forward and easy but slowly got more involved, and the last few labs were pretty much all up to you to figure out and design.  Exams are what you would expect from Short, crunch on time but fair."
"Valuable","Prof. Short does a good job of instilling the basics to the class, his lectures are concise and give a well-rounded overview of the subject matter. The subject matter itself can be dry at times, and involve a lot of memorizing of syntax, but the course teaches the fundamentals of a valuable skill set for engineers very well."
"Valuable","Kenneth Short goes out of his way to make sure everything he teaches meets industry standards. If I had to get a job right this moment, I'd be relying mostly on the things I've learned in 382 as well as his 380 course."
"Valuable","The structure of this course is phenomenal. Every class that also labs should inherit the structure and standards required in ESE38x courses."
"Valuable","Kenneth Short is the BEST professor in Stony Brook. Any class he teaches is crystal clear, challenging but rewarding."
"Valuable","Very useful, reinforce 218 concept on designing digital system. Very straightforward."
"Valuable","the lab section is too short, and i hope the lab section will have more hours"
"Valuable","embedded system programming experience in C"
"Needs Improvement","The exams and labs should be harder instead of focusing on the syntax. There should be more design problems on the exams and shorter questions. One can do really well on the lab and understand everything but simply cannot finish the test and score the same with someone with good knowledge of syntax but does not know contents as well. So many people share codes in the later labs. It is very hard to differentiate students who actually put in work and students who are just studying syntax the last minute before class."
"Needs Improvement","The lab portion of the course (which is the vast majority of the material) frequently ignored materials asked for in the lab manual and asked for things to be handed in at the beginning of lab that weren't mentioned on the manual at all. There should be more communication between those designing and grading the lab and those creating and assigning the manuals and guidelines for the lab in order to prevent this."
"Needs Improvement","This class was very good, but maybe go through the beginning material faster.  It was pretty simple and we spent a lot of time on it.  Also, spend more time on functions like to_integer, to_unsigned, unsigned, and integer as those confused myself and a few others.  The rest of the class was perfect."
"Needs Improvement","More practice before exams and more hands-on TA's."
"Needs Improvement","Perhaps slightly faster pacing if anything"
"Needs Improvement","Nothing at all."
"Needs Improvement","N/A"
