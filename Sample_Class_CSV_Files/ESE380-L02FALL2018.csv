"Valuable","Performing the labs reinforced understanding of embedded systems design."
"Valuable","Learning about hardware and using it in conjunction with software."
"Needs Improvement","Fix Lab 5.  It was far too long and too difficult to be the first lab where we had to write most of the code ourselves.  Some of the lab questions need to be revised to make them clearer.  Lab 1 needs more description added and possibly needs to be updated to reflect the latest Atmel Studio version."
"Needs Improvement","Allow more time for theory to be submitted."
"Needs Improvement","More lab time"
