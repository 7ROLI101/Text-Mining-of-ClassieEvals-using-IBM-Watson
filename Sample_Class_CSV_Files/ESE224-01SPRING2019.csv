"Valuable","Learned a lot about C++ in general, but the most valuable thing was probably learning how to bug-fix better. The language can be pretty finicky and the homework had questions that were difficult but fair. This resulted in a lot of bugs, but it was a valuable experience."
"Valuable","The assignments given were sufficient in teaching concepts of object oriented programming. The in class labs were very valuable especially when TAs and the professor were available."
"Valuable","While you don't learn a lot about C++ in class, the assignments really forces you to learn the topics the professor assigned on your own, with trials and errors"
"Valuable","I found the resources that she provided to us valuable. It saved me time from looking them up on google."
"Valuable","Learning how to extract information from API, online lectures, and other resources."
"Valuable","We know how to teach ourselves. We weren't learning much from this course."
"Valuable","The professor is very understanding and responsive"
"Valuable","The links that were posted on the course web-page."
"Valuable","Hands on experience"
"Needs Improvement","-Updating some material on Blackboard was not done in a timely manner.

-The instructor should give examples of what each feature of C++ during lecture, not just by uploading basic codes on Blackboard so that the ones who attend lecture get advantage. The homework problems should be related to what's taught and discussed in class, not to simulate unrelated math concepts.

- The instructor need to explain what it does, what syntax it has and how it can be applied, more thoroughly. I hope that she attends at one of ESE 124 Lecture held by Professor Parekh, ESE 305 lecture held by Peter Milder or ESE 372 lecture held by Leon Shterengas one day and see how they always try to interact with students by writing code line by line or every detail and explaining all the important details at each line before proceeding further, during lecture. If she follow his way, she wouldn't leave the lecture early and cancel lecture in untimely manner.

-If she thinks that she's busy all the time, she should think that:
1. students are as busy as her too,
2. students' time is also as important as hers
3. and she shouldn't think that she has an authority to waste students' time.

- If she cannot handle this class in a timely manner, then another person who is more organized and willing to teach needs to teach this course.

- When she teaches or advises, she should not say that students should look up cplusplus.com for anything we don't know. She is the one who has to teach. We pay tuition to learn. This is not a free class. She is the one who has to answer student's questions and teach.

-We don't know why we were told to use QT in this C++ class. Even if it was not mandatory, this is an off topic stuff that confuses students and wastes students' time. If the grad TA and the professor believed that QT was related to this introductory C++ course, they should've explained better about it, not just copy-pasting and throwing us an example code written by someone outside of this class.

ESE 224 is the introductory class for C++ in EE and CE department. We hope it's not the most improved version of this class."
"Needs Improvement","This class is a joke. First of all, attendance is worth 14% of your grade, which is ludicrous for a 8:30 programming class. Even in class, you really don't learn anything, since after the first three lectures you end up working on either homework or lab assignments. She just assumes you know everything. Literally the lecture before the midterm, she threw us a curve ball and told us that deque and que are on the midterm, even though the homework on deque and que was assigned after the test!!!! The grad TA wasn't very useful either. Whenever you ask him a question about your algorithm, he would insist that you need to do the problem in a certain way. If you can, I would suggest avoiding taking this class at all cost."
"Needs Improvement","Maybe having smaller assignments that are more frequent. There isn't much incentive to do the class labs instead of working on homework, so instead of having labs, more (smaller) homework could accomplish the same thing. Currently there are three big assignments that take a lot of time and have due dates far from when they're assigned, and some down time between assignments. The down time is nice but I think it promotes skipping class when nothing is due."
"Needs Improvement","I liked the idea of having a lab day lecture but towards the end every day was just working on the project and I don't even know how many days she actually taught anything. Like all the basic intro stuff was taught but then for more advanced concepts she just gave it to us and expected us to figure it out on our own and gave us some links that were common knowledge to everyone."
"Needs Improvement","Vibha is such a nice lady and she's very willing to help, but she isn't very good at helping or answering questions. The lectures were not very organized, and by mid-semester it seemed like she didn't really know what else to teach and just told us to google when we didn't understand."
"Needs Improvement","More material can be taught in the class. For a coding class, I felt like I learned very little about the language, even though I read all the provided slides and material. Most of what I learned could have been learned in a 2-hr YouTube video."
"Needs Improvement","Grading for midterm 1 being quicker. I wish algorithms were covered more before being tested in the midterm, or atleast if the algorithms that were being tested were more reasonable."
"Needs Improvement","The parenthesis problem on midterm was too hard for a midterm, it took me 2-3 days to figure it out as assignment 3."
"Needs Improvement","More time lecturing"
