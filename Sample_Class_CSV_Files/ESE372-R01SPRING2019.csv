"Valuable","FINALLY being taught how transistors work after hearing about them so much since ESE 123 is great. Understanding properly how bode plots and frequency responses in general are to be created and interpreted is also helpful. The professor is very helpful and willing to pace the lectures with the students' needs if things get boring or unclear."
"Valuable","The professor actually cares about the students and their understanding; he tends to go fast but will ask the class if the is going too fast or needs to repeat anything."
"Valuable","The practice problems were very helpful in applying the theory taught in the class to solving actual problems on the test."
"Valuable","The instructor was able to explain the material well."
"Valuable","the picture of the sheep falling to their deaths"
"Needs Improvement","The first third of the class feels disconnected from the latter two, focusing on diodes, filters, and rectifiers as one big topic while bipolar junction transistors and MOSFETS each get their own sections. Such a massive weight on exams (70% for midterms and finals vs 30% for homeworks) also seems excessive and puts too much pressure on students to not screw up on a specific day."
"Needs Improvement","I attended the recitation for this course once, the first day.  After about 20 minutes of the TA drilling through problems at the front of the room, I found it in my best interest to spend the time studying on my own or in a group of peers rather than waste time in that classroom."
"Needs Improvement","The material was taught well conceptually, but then the transition of how the concepts were taught to then how they were tested in both homeworks and exams was a but of a rough transition where they didn't always seem to directly correspond."
"Needs Improvement","I thought the recitations could have been more of a review of what was done during class instead of just doing a bunch of examples each week. It wasn't really a review of what was taught in class."
"Needs Improvement","ECHO the class so that material that he goes over more in-depth can be reviewed"
"Needs Improvement","none"
