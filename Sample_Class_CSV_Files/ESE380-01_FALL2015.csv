"Valuable","Professor Short is a great professor. His classes especially 380 require a lot of time commitment. However, I learned a lot in his class. The labs were interesting and really helped me learn about AVR microcontrollers."
"Valuable","Valuable experience in programming a microcontroller to perform different tasks. The importance of developing good coding, and more importantly, good debugging techniques were emphasized by the lab section."
"Valuable","This class forces you to learn assembly. If you want to stay afloat that is. Because of how rigorous this course is, I was able to come away with a really good foundation in assembly language programming."
"Valuable","Gives students a very in depth understanding of the Atmel architecture and multiple applications, but also how to create general electronic systems.  Familiarizes oneself with reading datasheets"
"Valuable","Assembly language and embedded systems is an essential topic that most engineers (electrical and computer) should take. Short really did a good job in explaining the material."
"Valuable","The professor extended our learning into less fundamental but more practical knowledge. We used what we learned in previous design classes to make useful systems."
"Valuable","The labs were incredibly useful for learning the material. Lecture was excellent for learning the material."
"Valuable","This course was very good in terms of learning about industry standards and embedded systems."
"Valuable","Learning AVR Assembly, understanding how to make professional-level schematics."
"Valuable","Being introduced to, and utilizing, Microcontrollers"
"Valuable","real world programming of electronic devices."
"Valuable","The review sessions were really helpful."
"Valuable","The powerpoints were very helpful."
"Valuable","Learning about assembly language"
"Valuable","Avr system building"
"Needs Improvement","Give students access to materials learned in lecture. I missed two lectures this semester because I honestly couldn't make it and it was almost impossible to find the information for the labs needed to complete the work for the weeks assignment. Since every assignment depends on the success of the prior week this set us back severely. If a student wants to learn the material they should be given access to the information necessary to do so. Sometimes students can't make it to lecture it seems silly to punish them by depriving them of access to  information, especially when the labs are cumulative and rely heavily on that information."
"Needs Improvement","1. have lectures slides available and completed atleast a day before the lecture and not the day of or have missing slides. 2. if he will make alterations or changes during class, after class updates the slides with the complete alterations that were made.3. give in class examples of the programming, like in all the other programming classes, not just bits and pieces of the programming codes on slides. 4 Show actual examples of different applications during class. 5. have reviews during actual class dates, either before or after class. 6 have exams on days that do not conflict with labs."
"Needs Improvement","I have issue with one thing in the lecture:

-I wasn't a fan with how the grading of the exams was inconsistent. I understand that the average was a little high and you wanted a harder test to offset it (I would have preferred that than what happened), but giving little to no partial credit honestly felt more like a hit job than anything. I think that you should have just made the second exam harder instead of just not giving partial credit as all it did was just demoralize people instead of actually helping them."
"Needs Improvement","The workload for this class was ludicrous.  No teacher is within their rights to assign this much work and expect such outrageous things from students.  This class gives much more than 4 credits worth of work.
Also, having a midterm average of ~30 is unnecessary.  Have normal tests with a normal average rather than trying to scare students with such a low average - it's bullying."
"Needs Improvement","The grading TAs are simply terrible.  They have no idea about the course material, and only grade according to the answer sheet.  I went to them multiple times and they had no idea how to do anything, to the point of telling me I was wrong when clearly, according to the datasheet, I was not (they also were unable to read the datasheet).  Getting decent TAs would be nice"
"Needs Improvement","Prf Short needs to teach students more about coding.
The materials learned in the class and shown in the tests are quiet different
because tests ask students to build algorithm and modify codes in very short amount of time.
He might say that these are learned from labs but lab instructors and TAs don't give feedback upon codes."
"Needs Improvement","Could go more off the book or put more notes online, like ones Prof. Short writes in class. Classes shouldn't punishing students because they can't come in. I feel as you are holding information from people from people not coming to class, which is not a good reason to hold information."
"Needs Improvement","When the professor says no embedded systems in class, he means it.  He WILL call you out in front of the entire class to tell you to put it away."
"Needs Improvement","Pace of the course was a bit fast. More time in lecture to spend on some examples rather than overview/basic theory would be beneficial."
"Needs Improvement","sometimes i want to see the example in the lecture. 
and i hope the professor to let me know what is included in the theory exactly."
"Needs Improvement","The lectures can get somewhat confusing. Considering this is a very difficult class already, not much could be done"
"Needs Improvement","Less work during mid-terms/finals week(s) should be considered, especially since labs take alot of time to do."
"Needs Improvement","The professor taught really well. There isn't much to be asked of him or the class."
"Needs Improvement","The expectations are a bit too high, in my opinion."
"Needs Improvement","Course is sonhard"
