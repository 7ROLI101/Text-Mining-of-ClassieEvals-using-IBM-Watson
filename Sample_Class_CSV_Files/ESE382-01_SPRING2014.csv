"Valuable","This course is fantastic. It does a great job of showing the power of VHDL and how to wield it effectively. The fact that we're actually able to synthesize and program chips with our code during lab is EXTREMELY valuable to us as students. It really lets us get our hands on each part of the design process that allows us to take a lot more away from the class than if we had just read about it in a textbook."
"Valuable","Throughout the semester the material was prepared ahead of time and was always well dictated and clear.  Both the lab and class professors make a great team and overall make this class great."
"Valuable","The power of designing with VHDL has become apparent over the course of the semester. While the learning curve may have been a bit steep, it was well worth the effort."
"Valuable","This course is extremely helpful for an CE student. Learn a lot in this class."
"Valuable","The content. VHDL is apparently very useful in life."
"Valuable","Coding skills and product design"
"Valuable","Great course, learned a lot."
"Valuable","Everything"
"Needs Improvement","I would say that the course would be improved with more streamlined lectures and lecture slides. The slides are usually very sufficient, but from time to time it's difficult to determine what is important and what isn't. Placing a greater emphasis on subjects of import would make the digestion of this material a little easier. 

Personally, I felt that I learned the most when actually coding VHDL. Perhaps writing the VHDL code in class might be a useful activity. (e.g. in lecture 'Lets write a D Flip Flop!' *open Aldec HDL and begin coding*)"
"Needs Improvement","Honestly, I think the course is structured very well. The final lab project puts everything we learned into larger context. Small homework assignments or quizzes may have been helpful towards the beginning of the semester in getting practice with the basic VHDL syntax."
"Needs Improvement","Professor Short is very knowledgeable and often shows his passion about the material, but he tends to be very boring in his delivery during lectures. He has a monotonic voice that makes people want to sleep. I hope he is not this way in ESE 380."
"Needs Improvement","This class is one of the best courses I have taken so far. Everything is clear."
"Needs Improvement","Perfect class, didn't find any flaw overall."
"Needs Improvement","N/A"
