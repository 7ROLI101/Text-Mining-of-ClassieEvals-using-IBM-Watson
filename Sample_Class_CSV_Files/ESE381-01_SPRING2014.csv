"Valuable","Professor Short simply put is the best instructor, professor, teacher whatever noun you prefer. His dedication to his student is unparalleled. Short's rooted mission is to have you work hard and additionally make you the best you can be within the confines of the course. The work and concepts are difficult, yet he is able to explain and elaborate on topic that would frustrate people to no end. This course is paramount for any electrical or computer engineer. I am taking this class because I wanted to continue to learn from Professor Short, in my opinion he is the best professor in the department. I am currently in my senior year and this class was not required, and I still took his course, I cannot stress to you enough how wonderful a professor he is. Short is down to earth and is extremely approachable. I would recommend any course that Professor Short teaches, he is just that damn good. It truly has been an honor to learn from him and I am truly grateful for all the knowledge I have gleaned from him."
"Valuable","Learning how to use embedded system using C is the most valuable experience;
Give us enough time to practice labs;
very interesting material."
"Valuable","Many real world applications taught in a memorable way."
"Needs Improvement","Better to make the exam more relevant to materials such as FSM, USART; 
If some DSP, OS or system on chip part be involved, it may be better. Frankly speaking, I have learned a lot in ESE381, very very interesting lab overall."
"Needs Improvement","More assistance in getting previous module codes working. So that the compounding labs don't overwhelm the students as we move forward."
