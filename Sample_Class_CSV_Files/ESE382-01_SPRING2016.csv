"Valuable","Professor Short has high expectations, and holds his students to in incredibly high standard. This is a good thing, however, because he crafts the course in such a way that the hard work feels rewarding. The laboratories are cumulative, and come together in the end to form a pretty complex design."
"Valuable","Overall this is a very great class. Professor Short is a great professor and his exams are always fair and test important concepts. The labs are great and do not take too long for most students."
"Valuable","Prof. Short is very knowledgeable and very helpful. His classes definitely worth the tuition. He holds review session on Saturdays like always."
"Valuable","Professor Short always completely answered my questions, without leaving any room for misunderstanding. Thanks for the great semester!"
"Valuable","I found it valuable to have learned VHDL syntax to be able to program in VHDL at a minimal level."
"Valuable","What was learned is very pratical, VHDL is a very useful tool"
"Valuable","Everything."

"Needs Improvement","- It is extremely difficult to stay awake in the class; much effort is required to do so. More so to pay attention.

- Especially towards the beginning of the semester, better examples could have been used to elaborate on the capabilities of the program. Coding examples can be significantly improved to make better use of the VHDL language overall.

- Tests are way too long for a given amount of time."
"Needs Improvement","The use of computer while lectures, so we can practice what he is lecturing"
"Needs Improvement","Better wording of laboratory manuals."
"Needs Improvement","Perfect."
