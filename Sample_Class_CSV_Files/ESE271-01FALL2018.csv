"Valuable","I have heard about many professors in the engineering department who are unorganised with the material, give ridiculously hard exams etc that make their course unbearable. Sergey is not one of these professors. He knows how to structure this class, teaches exactly what needs to be taught, and provides ample practice for the exams, which are based off of these practice problems. Its easy to take this class for granted early on in the semester, which is the worst thing you could do. Because if done right, and you listen to his lectures, you don't actually need to do much more. None of the concepts in Circuit analysis seem especially complicated and even if you do, just go to his office hours."
"Valuable","It was interesting to learn about circuits in a more thorough manner, however the lack of grading and feedback from the professor and TA led to me being unsure whether I actually learned the topics correctly or if I was even correctly doing the problems correctly. The professor as a person is nice and is willing to answer questions, but when the whole class is lost and he just keeps on lecturing no one is going to understand the topic completely and it discourages students from attending lectures (this was notable as less and less people showed up to lectures towards the end of the semester)."
"Valuable","This professors lectures were amazing . They were very detailed . They explained concepts very thoroughly . They were super informative. Durring the lectures the professor tried to interact with the students to further clarify anything that was confusing . This professor can teach very well which is evident through the lectures . The final review lecture and lectures notes were very helpful and very detailed as well. They helped students prepare for the final well, and was extremely useful for studying."
"Valuable","I liked the application of math and the material is very interesting as understanding and analyzing a circuit is the basis of electrical engineering. Although I was not able to attend myself I was told the office hours with the Professor were very good and really helped the students who attended to do well."
"Valuable","The professor teaches a lot of extra material which will be helpful for future classes. He teaches all the important elements of circuit analysis and is very helpful during office hours. He is also a very fair grader and is willing to bump up your grade if you show that you do understand the material."
"Valuable","Solving problems during lecture was great help as well as techniques used to solve problems more efficiently. Past exam examples and hw were well rounded material covered wise and were great help for preparing for tests."
"Valuable","I thought that this course served as a good introduction into circuits. It was valuable in that it was taught on a basic level and helped me to understand a topic that I was not sure if I was interested in."
"Valuable","Nothing much for my major as it focuses more on Biology and engineering. I don't see the applications of what I learned in this class in my career looking forwards but I'm sure it'll be useful eventually."
"Valuable","The course material was really interesting to me, I don't know how much concepts will reappear in my undergraduate study/later in life, but I enjoyed the course."
"Valuable","Maksim, you are a great TA and your devotion to us and the class was awesome. You clearly know your stuff and made learning the material much easier. Thank you."
"Valuable","Was a good introduction to circuit analysis. Helped see practical aspects to laplace transforms. TA and instructor were very helpful in office hours."
"Valuable","Clear instructions for systematically approaching problems. Not even online instructions are as clear which is rare."
"Valuable","Professor Suchalkin is really helpful at office hours. He takes the time to explain everything carefully."
"Valuable","The instructor knows the material well and lecture slides/homework convey the material well."
"Valuable","The lecture notes were very informative and the instructor explained them well."

"Needs Improvement","Feedback, feedback, feedback, every semester this is the main problem that students complained about in previous semester and it still has not changed. As of writing this, there are only two weeks left of classes, and we just got back our second midterm grade (graded by professor) which was about a month ago and the second homework grade (graded by TA) only some weeks ago when we had submitted it over two months ago. NOTE : We did not get the actual papers back, only just a random number appearing on blackboard. How am I supposed to improve, or know if I am learning the content from the course thoroughly if we aren't given thorough time to see our papers, or if we aren't given our homework back to be able to study from our mistakes? 
This is the first class where I have received ZERO of my work back that I have submitted.

Also a complaint that still holds to this semester, the content just gets more confusing and as a result,  without feedback we are not able to improve or try and get better at each topic. About the professor's slides, they just appear to be reused from previous years and he mainly reads off of them. If you can understand him (the professor holds the microphone way to close to his mouth and it sounds muffled even to this day), I can follow what he says but if I were to try and apply concepts it would not hold up.

As a person who attended this class every single day, it was not worth it at all with how the class was run.

It is unfortunate, I thought this class would be an important class to me as an Electrical Engineer but it turned out to be one of my worst classes of the semester and one of the worst I have taken at Stony Brook."
"Needs Improvement","Although it is evident that a lot of effort was put into the slides, I felt that they needed much more annotation to convey the basic concept as it was not clear to someone who is seeing the material for the first time. I would also like if example problems were to be done out on the board at times as well as take more questions from students during the lecture. I felt that the problems assigned on homework were oftentimes difficult in that the algebra and math could be so complicated that it obstructed from the general concepts, especially in the final third of the class; the manipulation was not clear to a normal person. In addition, I feel that the problems assigned should be more explicit and similar to what is presented in class; it took many hours to figure out the process. It would be nice to see more on circuit design and application as well as some conceptual intuition into the processes we used in problems: why does this work/why can we do this? Finally, please bring teaching methods from office hours into lecture as well, as many people mention that office hours are very good."
"Needs Improvement","The instructor was very confusing at times. He would prepare all of his slides in advanced and walk us though them, but sometimes I would get lost because he was pointing at things rather than writing on the slides as we went along. This also made lecture a little less engaging. He also had a very thick accent which made him hard to understand at times, and so I wish the class had been echoed so I could go back later and re-watch what I was confused about. This would have also been very helpful to me because I felt like he went very fast sometimes."
"Needs Improvement","Dr. Suchalkin is a great teacher and he is passionate while he teaches, but he often times teaches a little bit to quickly so it is easy to miss what he is saying. He also holds the microphone against his mouth so what he is saying is very muffled. I think this course would be improved quite a bit if he spoke slower and more clearly because it would often cause unnecessary confusion. It is by no means that he is unable to teach because in his office hours he was extremely helpful."
"Needs Improvement","The way Sergey taught is very fast and some topics would be thrown onto you 2 lectures prior to a midterm and you would be expected to know that topic. His lecture slides are 'detailed' in a way where you have to pay attention to him during lecture as he is explaining the slides so that you can understand how the work shown makes sense. If you don't then the slides may sometimes seem confusing or very messy."
"Needs Improvement","Professor does talk too fast during lecture and goes rather quickly. The slides could have more information  on them that actually explain what's going on, you won't learn from just reading them, you actually have to go to lecture to understand them. Professor could also upload the slides before lecture so student's can get an idea of that day's topics"
"Needs Improvement","More consistent expectations with homework. Alternated between a homework that would take 2 hours and homework that could take 10+ hours, both instances often only having 1 week to complete the work. Less time spent on theories and more on examples and applications could be helpful for tests."
"Needs Improvement","The lectures were taught using the pre-made slides. I think teaching freehand would be better than pre-made slides because freehand is easier to follow. But it should be done on the projector so it is easier to see, and the content can be uploaded to blackboard after lectures"
"Needs Improvement","Some material feels rushed, especially the transfer function and bode plots, and for most students it will be a big transition learning about Laplace and Fourier transform, but I don't see much that needs to be changed. Sergey is one of the good ones so take advantage of it."
"Needs Improvement","sergey seemed like a nice guy overall, but he either needs to get a new microphone or just keep it away from his mouth because there was always so much feedback coming from it that i could never even understand what he was saying"
"Needs Improvement","Homeworks were never returned, so we have no way of knowing if we are misunderstanding the material. It would be helpful to at least post the solutions to homework after the due date."
"Needs Improvement","The instructor was not present a lot of the time. Also it would be helpful if the instructor could do problems in class instead of having problems already written out on the slides"
"Needs Improvement","Maybe if the class was echoed, it would be easier to look back at lectures as the professor is hard to understand most of the time with the way he talks into the microphone."
"Needs Improvement","The microphone (possibly due to setup or instructor's use) made it very hard to understand the professor during lectures, which made them much less worth attending."
"Needs Improvement","Less filler: some things were rarely tested or on homework’s but were covered in lecture. Perhaps only 50% of the slides were relevant to get a good grade."
"Needs Improvement","professor could take the microphone away from his mouth a little and possibly start with clean slides and write steps"
"Needs Improvement","Less arithmetic on lecture notes, too hard to follow sometimes. More practical applications shown"
"Needs Improvement","If more time was spent making sure the lecture slides and helpful material did not contain errors"
"Needs Improvement","The professor goes through material very quickly. It is also hard to understand him sometimes."
"Needs Improvement","The professor could do some more practice problems in the lecture."
"Needs Improvement","The recitation is useless, so I suggest improve recitation."
"Needs Improvement","ECHO THE CLASS. we cannot understand the professor at all!"
"Needs Improvement","The homeworks were not always completely clear."
"Needs Improvement","Professor should not just read off his slides"
"Needs Improvement","This course had very little imperfections."
