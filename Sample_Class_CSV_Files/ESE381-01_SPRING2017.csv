"Valuable","The instructor was phenomenal, he is one of the best professors at Stony Brook. He cares about his students and gets you prepared for the world outside of school."
"Valuable","Professor Short posts a lot of reading material, and not a single document posted is without value. The readings helped me in lecture and in lab."
"Valuable","Learning the very fundamentals of how a microcontroller works, which can be carried over to microcontrollers from different companies."
"Valuable","I really enjoyed the extensive material that we learned."

"Needs Improvement","As some one who likes to put serious consideration into their course evals, I have to say I can not think of any direct or indirect ways to make this class better than it already is. I'm pretty sure the only way to improve this course would be to start providing concessions - coffee, donuts, the works. Of course they will have to be on par with the course, 381 is too good to be catered by second rate food services. I'm thinking you should keep it local, there are a few great places around Stony Brook and Port Jeff, that would be pretty classy. Outside of that, I don't know, maybe get professor Short an awesome theme song that plays whenever he enters the room."
"Needs Improvement","Add more content to the first laboratory. It is used as a tutorial for the basic coding environment, however, if you actually do the assigned readings beforehand, the entire first lab could be completed in 20 minutes or so."
"Needs Improvement","Topics and lectures are very interesting, but the professor's voice/tone makes people a bit sluggish."
"Needs Improvement","I think the only thing is to bring all the material learned in lecture into the laboratory."
