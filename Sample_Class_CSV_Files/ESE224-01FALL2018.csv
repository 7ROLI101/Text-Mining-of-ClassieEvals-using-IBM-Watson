"Valuable","Compared to ESE 124, we learned much more techniques in coding and important concepts such as classes and ways pointers could be used to implement a linked list. Although we learned a lot of syntax, we did start to learn much more interesting things at the ending part of the course such as linked lists of sorting and searching algorithms.

Unfortunately, with the lack of motivation for students to come to class (max 15 students in class out of the 90 total), the class was not worth attending even though I attended every single day."
"Valuable","Firstly, it must be said that Professor Subbarao is a very kind and helpful professor. Anytime a student had a question or concern, Prof. Subbarao was very fast to respond (whether in class, through email, or on the Piazza discussion board).

The class itself is a great step into C++ programming and covers a wide range of need-to-know topics such as linked-lists, inheritance, templates, and more. Even as someone with some prior programming experience, this class reinforced my knowledge of many concepts and taught me new things."
"Valuable","The lectures were very informative. The professor did a very good job explaining difficult concepts thoroughly. He tries very hard to be interactive with students. He helps to clarify concepts that are confusing to students. He gives good examples of actual code in class . He refers back to the textbook frequently durring the lectures. This professor is very good at teaching which is evident in his lectures. His lectures are very valuable."
"Valuable","I would like to recommend my TA, Wenyu Cao.
I had a great experience having him as a TA.
He always responded to emails very quickly and was always available for any questions.
He checked my projects ahead of time and let me know what can be fixed or changed.
He did everything to make sure I can learn and all things go smoothly.
Good course."
"Valuable","Professor assigns lots of projects. Projects are better than tests. Cause you are an engineer and you need some kinda hands-on experience. Test don't give you that. Professor is great in office hour. Professor always answer my question on Piazza so everyone can see his answer. The book is great but costs 80 bucks."
"Valuable","The projects and the fact that we used MindTap which allows students to read short powerpoints that go over the key points of the chapter instead of reading the actual book and also provided so many exercises."
"Valuable","He goes on tangents and doesn't show actual examples of code in class really. The class felt like it didn't really have much of a structure to it and i did most of my learning on Youtube or from the textbook"
"Valuable","It does give a solid foundation of the C++ programming and teaches all the basics needed to learn how to code. The textbook is helpful in learning, however it is too expensive"
"Valuable","Being a programming course, alot of the material could be learned online or from the textbook, also having taken ESE 124 (teaching a similar language) helped."
"Valuable","The first exam was the hardest, the others gradually became easier and easier despite the topics being difficult and the homeworks/projects taking forever"
"Valuable","Large emphasis on generic c++ code, using new and delete for dynamically allocating memory"
"Valuable","The book And the cenegate are super expensive and useless!"

"Needs Improvement","The professor should give some incentive for students to come to class. He always said that students just did not come because this stuff is 'trivial' (you will hear this a lot), but in reality the class was just not taught well. He would assume everyone though something was trivial and would almost never show syntax. Sure, syntax can be boring, but when it is a brand new concept that we have not learned about like classes, syntax is necessary in order for us to learn and be able to apply things ourselves. But this was not done, and instead the professor would say this is 'trivial' and skip on or start talking verbally about code. Instead the professor would just say to read and learn from the textbook.

Onto the textbook, the professor basically made us buy the textbook and online content, but then towards the end of semester he dropped the online homework basically making us waste money, and also made the lasts tests closed book, which therefore made the textbook a waste of money too. The first 2-3 weeks of classes it seemed like he was marketing the textbook because he was getting paid for it or something, saying it was an investment and was worth it. I will agree it was useful, but this is because the professor could not teach the content and code thoroughly and instead made us read from the textbook.

If you are a beginner in coding, or consider yourself to not be good at coding, this class might be very difficult for you. Sure the first two tests were open textbook but the averages were not too high.

I personally think the professor is a good person, as he is willing to extend deadlines or help explain something if he can. But as a teacher, he was not effective in teaching concepts and as a result only 1/6 of the class showed up consistently and it led the professor to believe that everything we learned was just 'trivial' to everyone else."
"Needs Improvement","The professor forces students to learn all the basics of the programming language on their own with no explanations related to programming until the day before the first exam. Almost all lectures are wasted explaining projects that are posted without fully being thought through and that are subject to changes. The professor also has decided to move majority of our final to a date the week classes end instead of allowing us to use that time for review. On top of that, students were informed late into the semester that we would be needing physical copies of the textbook for our exams, which costed an extra $80 minimum and then the day before the first exam, the professor changed his mind to allow for sheets of paper to be used during the exam after many students already wasted large sums of money. Overall this class is run terribly and all the material must me learned on our own with little programming taught by the professor at all throughout the entire semester."
"Needs Improvement","The lectures were often taught using already exists codes and sites. I think it would be better to teach by constructing code from scratch in visual studio and explaining how it works as it is written. This is not only easier to follow, but the code from the lecture can be uploaded to blackboard to future reference.

The MindTap thing at the start of the semester was very messy and confusing. While I didn't buy it, it was not fair to those who did spend the money because it ended up never working from the looks of it and didn't seem very helpful. I would suggest that the materials to buy just be a rental textbook, which is what I got. It helped in learning and I could bring it for the open book exams. Just the textbook, no MindTap."
"Needs Improvement","I wish the class was more structured. I could plan my work for the week for all of my other classes because they were so consistent with the work they gave (calc hw due every friday) but the assignments for this course were a bit of a curveball sometimes. However, he would give us a decent amount of time to complete them and was very considerate when asked for an extension which balanced out the lack of structure."
"Needs Improvement","The professor could explain the material better, all he does is read the textbook to the class. Made us pay $80 to access mindtap, yet only used it for the first month and a half of the semester, effectively wasting money. Pace was too fast, he covered an entire chapter a day which is fine for the earlier stuff, but gets more complicated once we reach classes"
"Needs Improvement","The course was better learned by just staying home and reading the textbook. There was no incentive to attend lecture because the instructor just read off pages of the textbook while skipping most pages, and maybe did a small demonstration on the chalkboard here and there. If there was more incentive to attend lecture the class would be better."
"Needs Improvement","I enjoyed using Cengage MindTap and wish that it functioned well enough in order to use it through out the semester.  I do not appreciate having to purchase it in order to only use it for the first month or so.

Also, the instructions given by the professor could have been clearer in order to make the class a little bit easier."
"Needs Improvement","New professor who doesn't teach out of the textbook or requires an $80 purchase to do two homeworks, projects more related to electrical engineering applications rather than the topic at hand, more consistent assignments and/or grading"
"Needs Improvement","Live programming exams. Test students on their logical skills when designing a program as opposed to their memory of useful lines of code. Test 3 was particularly a major culprit of this. A programming class shouldn’t be rote."
"Needs Improvement","Lectures are not worth attending.  The instructor discusses concepts but most the time spent in the hall did not directly pertain to the course material."
"Needs Improvement","Give the class more structure, show more examples of code in class, and less regurgitation from the textbook"
"Needs Improvement","Don't use cengage, make your own slides and homeworks. Don't tell students they don't have to come to class."
"Needs Improvement","The book And the cenegate are super expensive and useless! I don’t think we need those for the class."
"Needs Improvement","The professor needs to do more coding in lecture and go through the textbook less."
"Needs Improvement","In lecture don't just read the textbook. Show and explain examles"
"Needs Improvement","I would like for the class to be just a little more structured."
"Needs Improvement","None comes to mind at the moment. Mostly personal improvement."
"Needs Improvement","If I have the test book, I learn nothing from professor."
"Needs Improvement","use more cengage or projects based on Chapters"
"Needs Improvement","The course had very little imperfections ."
"Needs Improvement","Replace the professor"
