"Valuable","ESE380 is a very valuable introduction and dive into the use and operation of microcontrollers. Prior to this class I knew little to nothing about what's going inside of a microcontroller. Professor Short paces the material nicely, from complete beginner (configuring port registers and assembly language syntax) to more advance features (like interrupts and timers).

Now that I've completed the course, I feel confident in my abilities to apply microcontrollers in personal projects. My coding skills have gained too, knowing what is happening at such a low level in a computer puts a different twist on how one view's a program.

A shout out is due to Scott for all the time and work he puts into running the ESE380 lab. He was a great help and did a great job explaining the laboratory tasks at the start of each lab."
"Valuable","This course teaches you a lot of the basic fundamentals of how to use a microcontroller, which is very important in CE and EE. Most technologies currently utilize microcontrollers in some form and it is vital to understanding how a lot of processes work. The labs were all interesting and taught you how to use the applied theory from class."
"Valuable","Professor Short is amazing, probably one of the best professors I've had at SBU. He teaches the material EXTREMELY well and leaving this course, I actually feel I have learned alot from him. The class is alot of work but very well taught."
"Valuable","The class is fantastic. I'm EE, but I still really enjoyed learning assembly in this class. Professor Short is a fantastic professor and really teaches the material well."
"Valuable","The lab course in tandem is quite valuable practical application"
"Needs Improvement","The course can be improved by having graduate TAs who actually know embedded systems or have some background in it. It is frustrating when your TAs don't know much about the topic and were assigned randomly to their position. The undergraduate TAs were great, but the graduate TAs should have been better considered before their placement."
"Needs Improvement","In the beginning the class feels very harsh and detail-oriented just for the sake of it. As the semester goes on it becomes a lot more reasonable. I suppose this is by design, but I think the strict grading policy at the start was more stressful than beneficial."
"Needs Improvement","The final few labs have a very rapid learning curve, perhaps try to avoid unnecessary delays earlier on in the semester to allow more time to cover these denser topics."
"Needs Improvement","The lab's towards the end are a little hard, but doable. Other than that, everything is fine."
"Needs Improvement","bigger room for review sessions."
"Needs Improvement","less paper work (lab report)"
