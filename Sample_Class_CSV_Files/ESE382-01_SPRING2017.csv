"Valuable","Lab materials are interesting and useful, and they are designed to combine with lectures well! Doing the lab is interesting and a very good practice for the knowledge taught in lecture. 
Professor Short is the big reason why the course is so valuable. Also, Scott and TAs make the labs runing well! One of the. Best course you won't regret to take!"
"Valuable","Everything! This course was a lot of fun. Professor Short gave us weekly challenges to get through the labs, and the tools and skills to meet those challenges. This experience may have shaped my future career."
"Valuable","VHDL is ESE 218 but funner since there is no frustrating miswiring. It made me realize how much i enjoy simulation and design through coding."
"Valuable","Prof Short, is a motivating individual, will make you work for every bit of your grade but he makes engineering possible."
"Valuable","I learned a very useful programming language that's equivalent to virtual hardware engineering."
"Valuable","The textbook which was written by Professor Short , and the review sessions for the tests."
"Valuable","A very good introduction to VHDL, which will be valuable in future courses"
"Valuable","Professor knew what he was teaching. Labs were very helpful."
"Valuable","."
"Needs Improvement","I felt like the tests were pretty difficult (except for the third). Essentially, you have an hour and a half to do 3 or 4 problems that are as hard/harder than the weekly labs. The little 'gotchas' that Prof. Short puts in there to check your attention to detail are just annoying, although I do admit, they probably make me a better thinker and, ultimately, engineer. I can't complain too much, quite frankly, I loved the course."
"Needs Improvement","Most labs have students complete the same exact design task in several  different methods (if statement, case statement, loop, etc.).  Would be more interesting if there were different tasks to complete"
"Needs Improvement","Nothing, this man absolutely cares about engineering, diversity, discipline and growth. Blessed to have this individual on the faculty at Stony Brook."
"Needs Improvement","Prof. Short does an excellent job of teaching the material, and I would not ask for more."
"Needs Improvement","i've never been a fan of coding tests but its not like Short would ever get rid of it"
"Needs Improvement","The course is good enough!"
"Needs Improvement","No ways."
"Needs Improvement","."
