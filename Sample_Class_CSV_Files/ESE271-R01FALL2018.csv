"Valuable","Sergey has organised this course and the exams really well. He teaches the concepts and gets down to the problems during lecture, and the final was exactly like the practice problems he had given us. Fantastic teacher, really fair expectation from students. Attend class and this course is a breeze."
"Valuable","This is the recitation part of ESE 271. My TA was Maksim, and he was alright. He tried his best to go through the example problems and explain to us the concepts, as well as answer any questions we had."
"Valuable","The TA knew the material well and always took many questions from students which were very clarifying."
"Valuable","The content taught"
"Needs Improvement","In office hours, I wished that the TA would sit with everyone and take questions. Although I liked the individual attention of asking one on one, I wished it would be where everyone can ask and take turns as I would feel bad to take the time away from everyone else."
"Needs Improvement","The homeworks take way too long to grade. It took 5 weeks for them to grade homework 2 and put up the grades on blackboard. It's a little unfair, because you don't see what you did wrong on the problems before taking the midterms."
"Needs Improvement","Recitation feels pointless because everything that we need to know is covered in lecture, so having a recitation is a waste of time and resources for everyone involved."
"Needs Improvement","Each midterm could've been changed or modified to verify whether students did learn the material or not."
"Needs Improvement","Check the slides and helpful content for errors more often"
